# What is Cryptography?

## Notes
* Crypto core:
	* Secret key establishment
	* Secure communication
* Applications include digital signatures, anonymous communication, anonymous digital cash
* Cryptography theorem: “anything that can be done with a trusted auth. can also be done without”
* Privately outsourcing computation is possible with cryptography (theoretically for now), e.g. a user can encrypt a search query to Google and get back encrypted results without Google knowing the contents of the query
* 3 steps in cryptography for establishing a primitive:
	* Precisely specify thread model (what can an attacker do)
	* Propose a construction
	* Prove that breaking construction under threat model will solve an underlying hard problem
